# Rest Test v02

&npsb;

Prerequisites:
1. run 'npm install'.
2. Install Mongoose Database Community Edition.
3. Have nothing running on ports 3000 and 27017(default port form mongoDB) or change the port values in the code.


&npsb;

Details:

In this version I connected the frontend to the backend which creates a very basic full-stack application.

&npsb;

Dependencies I used Express to create the server and mongoose to access the database (mongoose is only a dependency that helps communicating to DB IT IS NOT 'Mongoose Database')

&npsb;

I connected backend to frontend by using two different ports running on localhost then I used XMLHTTPRequest and fetch() to request data and send data.
