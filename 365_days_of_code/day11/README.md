# Dependencies(NODE JS & GIT BASH)

For this program to work you will need node.js installed on your computer and git bash.

If you dont have node js and or git bash installed then go to the official websites to download them for your distro.

If you do have node and git bash or just installed it then open your git bash terminal then switch to the directory containing the data bank program then simply type 'node login_readline_program.js'.

Syntax to run any node file 'node filename.js'

To exit this program press 'ctrl c' - Sorry about that.
