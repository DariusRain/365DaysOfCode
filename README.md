# [ Days 239 - 246 ](https://github.com/DariusRain/hackr)
[Back-End Practice](https://github.com/DariusRain/back-end-practice/tree/master/practice):  Created an enviroment for testing back-end code. <br />
[Front-End Practice](https://github.com/DariusRain/front-end-practice): Created an enviroment for testing front-end code. <br />
[Algorithm Practice](https://github.com/DariusRain/algorithm-practice): Created an enviroment for solving algorithms. <br />
[Brainhive2](https://github.com/DariusRain/brainhive2): Started integrating a back-end into Brainhive2. <br />
[Hackr](https://github.com/DariusRain/hackr) Started integrating the front-end to swap from pugjs to reactjs. <br />

Overall: <br />
- Good practice on using jwt, bcryptjs again in another [program](https://github.com/DariusRain/brainhive2) and the use of the request headers. <br />
- Learning that [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) is'nt needed just to run a mern stack application & that you typically see or want the client and server separate. <br />
- Also [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) isnt needed either, where you can just ignore files from github during a push with git. Or just set the enviroment variables via shell on the platform. <br /> 
  the application is running on. <br />
- Getting new with mongoosejs projection and how to use it to query and modify datat in MongoDB Atlas or Local Databases. <br />

# [ Days 232 - 239 ](#)
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/api/api-reference):  Getting more familiar with Redux, creating reducers, actions and action creators. <br />
[React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect): Using connect to connect my React application to Redux. <br />

<br />
Overall: <br />
Dived deep into action creators, and using them to communicate with the reducer in order which modifies its own state & there can be multiple reducers that have their own state which branches from the global state or store.
